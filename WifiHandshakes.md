| Key               | Description             |
| -----------       | -----------             |
| PSK               | Pre-shared Key - Wifi password          |
| PMK               | Pairwise Master Key - derived from the PSK using PBKDF2     |
| PTK               | Pairwise Transient Key  |
| GTK               | Group Temporal Key      |
| ANonce / SNonce   | Random numbers (nonces) |
| MIC               | Message Integrity Code  | 


**PSK** Pre-shared key
: Wifi-password, both AP and client know 

**PMK** Pairwise MasterKey
: derived from the PSK using PBKDF2

**PTK** Pairwise Transient Key
: Unique per session, encrypts traffic

**GTK** Group Temporal Key
: USed for multicast/broadcast encryption

**ANonce/SNonce**
: Nonce - random number, generated by AP and client

**MIC** Message Integrity Code
: Proves that the party has the right keys


OS notes
scheduling & resource management
deadlock detection/deadlock avoidance
given graphs, demonstrate that the system isnt deadlocked

scheduling questions about given procesess coming into the system, be able to calculate average wait time, (roundrobin for example) given arrival time, burst, etc data
